[00:00:00] Speaker 1: I have a huge announcement to make.
[00:02:41] Speaker 1: Huge.
[00:06:55] Speaker 1: Are you ready?
[00:07:65] Speaker 1: Are you ready?
[00:09:52] Speaker 1: Yesterday Apple made a huge announcement.
[00:13:93] Speaker 1: That's my announcement.
[00:18:96] Speaker 1: It just seemed like everybody was so excited about their announcement, so I thought if I, if I also said I have a huge I would get the same kind of, so.
[00:27:72] Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, they announced that the iPhone 10 uh is is out now.
[00:32:46] Speaker 1: So the iPhone 10, if anyone has an iPhone, just throw that away.
[00:36:78] Speaker 1: Just.
[00:38:88] Speaker 1: immediately on your way out just find a trash can and toss it.
[00:42:37] Speaker 1: Here's what happened yesterday.
[00:43:53] Speaker 1: They announced the iPhone 8 and then five minutes later, they announced the new iPhone 10.
[00:49:15] Speaker 1: So the iPhone 8 is already out.
[00:52:16] Speaker 1: They went from 8 to 10.
[00:55:02] Speaker 1: And I bet you're wondering what happened to iPhone 9.
[00:59:16] Speaker 1: I think it's clear 7 8 9.
[01:10:35] Speaker 1: Get it?
[01:11:15] Speaker 1: 7 8 9.
[01:13:90] Speaker 1: Anybody have kids?
[01:15:70] Speaker 1: I'm not going to talk about the eight because who cares?
[01:18:27] Speaker 1: I'm going to talk about the 10 and I have one of those clickers they use at uh Apple for the big presentations.
[01:23:46] Speaker 1: And so, um, all right.
[01:25:29] Speaker 1: So, uh, here this is the iPhone uh, this is iPhone X.
[01:30:46] Speaker 1: And it sells for $1,000.
[01:34:39] Speaker 1: The X stands for expensive.
[01:38:84] Speaker 1: Expensive.
[01:42:25] Speaker 1: Here's one of the big changes right here.
[01:44:11] Speaker 1: Uh, the glass is uh not only in the front, and now it is also in the back.
[01:49:25] Speaker 1: So now you can break both sides.
[01:53:77] Speaker 1: Yeah.
[01:54:19] Speaker 1: Yeah, it's for those of us who cracked the front and thought, I could do better.
[01:58:39] Speaker 1: I know I can.
[02:00:23] Speaker 1: No, it's actually a good thing because now you can charge your phone without plugging it in.
[02:04:22] Speaker 1: Yeah, you put it on uh like a a hot plate.
[02:09:59] Speaker 1: Any any hot plate, I think.
[02:12:93] Speaker 1: I don't know, you just turn it up as hot as it goes and I think that charges faster.
[02:17:34] Speaker 1: Hot plates are going to sell out.
[02:18:29] Speaker 1: Hot plates are going to sell like hot plates, you guys.
[02:21:55] Speaker 1: They also made the screen bigger.
[02:23:47] Speaker 1: It's not that big.
[02:24:27] Speaker 1: That's not life size.
[02:26:22] Speaker 1: That'd be ridiculous.
[02:27:54] Speaker 1: It's a 5.8 inches and 4.8 when it's cold.
[02:37:37] Speaker 1: Thank you.
[02:44:60] Speaker 1: And here's the coolest part.
[02:45:51] Speaker 1: To unlock your phone, it uses facial recognition.
[02:49:50] Speaker 1: Look at this.
[02:50:85] Speaker 1: This is so weird.
[02:51:50] Speaker 1: I don't even know how this is working.
[02:52:47] Speaker 1: This is my garage clicker, but anyway.
[02:58:14] Speaker 1: So it uses facial recognition.
[02:59:93] Speaker 1: Here's how it works.
[03:00:99] Speaker 1: You just uh, you look at it and it opens it.
[03:04:54] Speaker 1: And the technology is so smart, all you have to do is scan your face once.
[03:08:49] Speaker 1: And then again after you get a haircut.
[03:10:73] Speaker 1: And then again after you get a nose job.
[03:12:98] Speaker 1: And then again after you buy a hat.
[03:15:83] Speaker 1: And then again when you finally lose that 15 lbs you've been trying to lose.
[03:20:70] Speaker 1: And then again when you gain that 15 lbs back.
[03:23:51] Speaker 1: The iPhone's going to keep you busy, you guys.
[03:26:81] Speaker 1: I I think I've said enough to Apple uh, they could maybe send me a free phone.
[03:30:26] Speaker 1: Don't you think I've said enough?
[03:31:18] Speaker 1: Maybe uh.
[03:36:10] Speaker 1: Maybe.
