[00:00:00] Speaker 1: I have a huge announcement to make.
[00:02:18] (audience cheers)
[00:06:50] Speaker 1: Are you ready?
[00:07:220] Speaker 1: Are you ready?
[00:08:44] (audience cheers)
[00:09:82] Speaker 1: Yesterday, Apple made a huge announcement.
[00:13:952] Speaker 1: That's my announcement.
[00:15:22] (audience laughs and applauds)
[00:18:962] Speaker 1: It just seemed like everybody was so excited about their announcement, so I thought if I,
[00:23:432] Speaker 1: if I also said I have a huge, I would get the same kind of...
[00:26:472] Speaker 1: So...
[00:27:822] Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, they announced that the iPhone 10, uh, is is out now.
[00:32:892] Speaker 1: So the I-iPhone 10, if anyone has an iPhone, just throw that away.
[00:37:12] (audience laughs)
[00:38:702] Speaker 1: Just immediately, on your way out, just find a trash can and toss it.
[00:42:362] Speaker 1: Here's what happened yesterday, they announced the iPhone 8 and then five minutes later, they announced the new iPhone 10.
[00:49:12] (audience laughs)
[00:49:622] Speaker 1: So the iPhone 8 is already out.
[00:51:672] (audience laughs)
[00:52:252] Speaker 1: They went from 8 to 10.
[00:54:992] Speaker 1: And I bet you're wondering what happened to iPhone 9.
[00:58:392] (audience laughs)
[00:59:382] Speaker 1: I think it's clear, 7 8 9.
[01:01:212] (audience laughs and applauds)
[01:10:492] Speaker 1: Get it?
[01:11:42] Speaker 1: 7, 8, 9.
[01:12:472] (audience laughs)
[01:13:762] Speaker 1: Anybody have kids?
[01:15:132] (audience laughs)
[01:15:932] Speaker 1: I'm not going to talk about the 8 because who cares.
[01:18:292] Speaker 1: I'm going to talk about the 10 and I have one of those clickers they use at, uh, Apple for the big presentations.
[01:23:612] Speaker 1: And so, um, all right, so, uh, here, this is the iPhone, uh, this is iPhone X.
[01:30:22] Speaker 1: It sells for $1,000.
[01:33:432] (audience gasps)
[01:34:602] Speaker 1: The X stands for expensive.
[01:36:582] (audience laughs and applauds)
[01:39:222] Speaker 1: Expensive.
[01:42:472] Speaker 1: Here's one of the big changes right here.
[01:44:422] Speaker 1: Uh, the glass is, uh, not only in the front, and now it is also in the back.
[01:49:172] Speaker 1: So, now you can break both sides.
[01:51:242] (audience laughs and applauds)
[01:54:212] Speaker 1: Yeah, it's for those of us who cracked the front and thought, I could do better.
[01:57:482] (audience laughs)
[01:58:702] Speaker 1: I know I can.
[02:00:242] Speaker 1: No, it's actually a good thing because now you can charge your phone without plugging it in.
[02:04:32] Speaker 1: Yeah, you put it on, uh, like a a hot plate.
[02:08:702] (audience laughs)
[02:10:112] Speaker 1: Any any hot plate, I think.
[02:12:352] (audience laughs)
[02:13:412] Speaker 1: I don't know, you just turn it up as hot as it goes and I think that charges faster.
[02:17:342] Speaker 1: Hot plates are going to sell out.
[02:18:422] Speaker 1: Hot plates are going to sell like hot cakes, you guys.
[02:20:532] (audience laughs)
[02:21:402] Speaker 1: They also made the screen bigger.
[02:23:442] Speaker 1: It's not that big.
[02:24:202] Speaker 1: That's not life-size.
[02:25:702] (audience laughs)
[02:26:562] Speaker 1: That'd be ridiculous.
[02:27:642] Speaker 1: It's a 5.8 inches and 4.8 when it's cold.
[02:32:152] (audience laughs and applauds)
[02:44:592] Speaker 1: And here's the coolest part.
[02:45:622] Speaker 1: To unlock your phone, it uses facial recognition.
[02:49:182] Speaker 1: Look at this.
[02:50:662] Speaker 1: This is so weird.
[02:51:342] Speaker 1: I don't even know how this is working.
[02:52:432] Speaker 1: This is my garage clicker, but anyway.
[02:55:22] (audience laughs)
[02:58:242] Speaker 1: It's work.
[02:58:652] Speaker 1: So, it uses facial recognition.
[03:00:152] Speaker 1: Here's how it works.
[03:01:2] Speaker 1: You just, uh, you look at it and it opens it.
[03:04:182] Speaker 1: And the technology is so smart, all you have to do is scan your face once, and then again after you get a haircut, and then again after you get a nose job, and then again after you buy a hat, and then again when you finally lose that 15 pounds you've been trying to lose, and then again when you gain that 15 pounds back.
[03:23:712] Speaker 1: The iPhone is gonna keep you busy, you guys.
[03:25:882] (audience laughs)
[03:26:712] Speaker 1: I I think I've said enough to Apple, uh, they could maybe send me a free phone.
[03:30:72] Speaker 1: Don't you think I've said enough?
[03:31:12] Speaker 1: Maybe a...
[03:32:82] (audience cheers and applauds)
[03:36:202] Speaker 1: Maybe.
